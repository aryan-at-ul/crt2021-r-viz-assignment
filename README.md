**The dataset marathon.csv gives results from the 2018 Dublin city marathon scraped from https://www.tdleventservices.co.uk/event-results/events?event=3073. General marathon information is here http://kbcdublinmarathon.ie**

Read in the data with

```
library(tidyverse)
m <- read_csv("marathon.csv")
```

# ASSIGNMENT :

**You should write a report with three parts:**

1. State some questions appropriate for the data.

2. Write a paragraph detailing the subset of the data relevant to your questions, an overview of its structure, and whether any adjustments to the data are required.

3. For each of the questions you posed, build visualisations that provide an answer. Write a paragraph describing the information gleaned from the visualisation and how it answers your question.

***Your written report including graphs and tables should be a maximum of three pages in length. You should supply in a separate file the code necessary to produce the graphs.***

***Rmarkdown may be useful to write your report. In Rstudio, do File>New File> R markdown to get started. You could look at the .Rmd files for my lectures on github also.***
